# Usage

Assuming you have already [installed the reporter][installation], run your tests with `jest` as usual, e.g.:

```bash
npm test
# jest ...
# PASS  ./my.test.js
```

Upon the test completion, you will see the `allure-results` directory generated in the root of your project.

To see the HTML report, serve it with Allure CLI:

```bash
allure serve
# Generating report to temp directory...
# Report successfully generated to /var/folders/lm/thz8hdxs4v3fppjh0fjc2twhfl_3x2/T/14940417964840933584/allure-report
# Starting web server...
# Server started at <http://192.168.0.43:56073/>. Press <Ctrl+C> to exit
```

and then browse the results stored in the `allure-results` directory via:

```bash
allure serve
```

If you want to generate a static report, e.g., for CI, run:

```bash
allure generate
```

Congratulations! Now, when you are looking at your report, let's learn more about it and how to customize it.
