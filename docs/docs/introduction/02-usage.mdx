# Usage

:::caution

This website version refers to the unreleased version of `jest-allure2-reporter`, partially available as `2.0.0-beta.3` release.
Please use GitHub docs for the latest stable version, `1.x.x`.

:::

Assuming you have already [installed the reporter][installation], run your tests with `jest` as usual, e.g.:

```bash
npm test
# jest ...
# PASS  ./my.test.js
```

and then browse the results stored in the `allure-results` directory via:

```bash
allure serve
```

If you want to generate a static report, e.g., for CI, run:

```bash
allure generate
```

For more information on `allure` CLI itself, see the documentation on its [official website](https://docs.qameta.io/allure/#_get_started).
