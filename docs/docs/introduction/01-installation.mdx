# Installation

## Prerequisites

### Jest

To use `jest-allure2-reporter` in your project, you have to be using
[`jest`](https://jestjs.io) as your test runner. The minimum supported version is `27.x`.

:::tip

Use Jest's default `jest-circus` runner for the full reporting functionality. Reports generated with any other runners like `jest-jasmine` will be incomplete and contain only the most essential information.

:::

### Allure CLI

In the most cases, you'd like to serve or generate HTML reports from the generated JSON files in `allure-results` directory.

To do so, make sure you have [`allure-commandline`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/allure-commandline) installed:

```bash
$ allure --version
2.27.0
```

:::details

::summary[If you don't have Allure CLI installed]

First of all, make sure you have Java 17 installed on your machine:

```bash
java -version
# openjdk version "17.0.1" 2024-01-16
# OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 17.0.10+0)
```

To install Allure CLI globally, run:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install -g allure-commandline
```

To install Allure CLI locally (per project), run:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save-dev allure-commandline
```

:::

However, if you generate the HTML reports elsewhere, you can skip this step.


## Setup

Use your package manager to add `jest-allure2-reporter` to the project:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install --save-dev jest-allure2-reporter
```

Edit your Jest configuration file this way:

```js title="jest.config.js"
 /** @type {import('@jest/types').Config.InitialOptions} */
 module.exports = {
    // …
// highlight-start
    testEnvironment: 'jest-allure2-reporter/environment-node',
    reporters: [
      'default',
      'jest-allure2-reporter',
    ],
// highlight-end
   // …
 };
```

At this point, you are ready to run your tests with the reporter.
