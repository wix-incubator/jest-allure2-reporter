## What is `jest-allure2-reporter`?

[`jest-allure2-reporter`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest-allure2-reporter) is a reporting toolkit for [Jest](https://jestjs.io/), a widely popular testing framework in the JavaScript ecosystem.

The produced reports look like directories with multiple JSON files.
They can be viewed using the [`allure` command-line tool][allure-cli], a flexible, feature-rich reporting tool that provides clear and concise test result representation.

It provides several **entry points**:

<dl>
  <dt><code>jest-allure2-reporter</code></dt>
  <dd>The reporter itself, which is responsible for collecting test results and generating a report.</dd>
  <dd>DSL to add additional metadata to your test definitions: <code>$Link</code>, <code>$Owner</code>.</dd>
  <dd>`allure` runtime API to use inside your tests: <code>allure.step</code>, <code>allure.attachment</code>.</dd>
  <dt>
    <b>Environment packages</b>, to enable the annotations, media attachments and provide additional test data:
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <dl>
      <dt><code>jest-allure2-reporter/environment-node</code></dt>
      <dd>For Node.js tests.</dd>
      <dt><code>jest-allure2-reporter/environment-jsdom</code></dt>
      <dd>For browser tests.</dd>
      <dt><code>jest-allure2-reporter/environment-decorator</code></dt>
      <dd>For advanced use cases where you need to extend an already customized test environment.</dd>
    </dl>
  </dd>
</dl>

## Why one more Allure reporter for Jest?

Jest's evolution from Jasmine to its own [Circus test runner](https://github.com/jestjs/jest/pull/3668) in [version 27.0.0](https://jestjs.io/blog/2021/05/25/jest-27#flipping-defaults) brought new opportunities for enhanced testing, but it also created a void: existing Allure reporters[^1], designed for Jasmine, fell short of leveraging Jest's new features and refined test lifecycle.

While community-made reporters sought to bridge this gap[^2][^3][^4], they had their own shortcomings &mdash; issues with irregular maintenance, limited reach, and significant feature gaps were prevalent. Most critically, they took a non-idiomatic approach by acting as extensions to Jest's `testEnvironment`, which led to a critical shortcomings: e.g., inability to report early test issues like `SyntaxError` or test environment setup failures.

## Takeaways

* This reporter is a powerful tool tailor-made for the **modern** Jest ecosystem, not "yet another Allure reporter".
* Easy to understand, straightforward to adopt, and flexible to work with â€“ it's the Jest Allure reporter you've been waiting for.
* It is progressive by design &mdash; you can start using it like a [standard reporter][jest-reporters], but the more you invest in it, the more you get out of it.
