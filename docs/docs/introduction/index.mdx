## What is `jest-allure2-reporter`?

[`jest-allure2-reporter`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest-allure2-reporter) is a reporting toolkit for [Jest](https://jestjs.io/), a widely popular testing framework in the JavaScript ecosystem.

**It has a few entry points:**

<dl>
  <dt><code>jest-allure2-reporter</code></dt>
  <dd>The reporter itself, which is responsible for collecting test results and generating a report.</dd>
  <dt><code>jest-allure2-reporter/annotations</code></dt>
  <dd>A set of functions and decorators to add additional metadata to your tests.</dd>
  <dt>
    Environment packages, to enable the annotations and provide additional test data:
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <dl>
      <dt><code>jest-allure2-reporter/environment-node</code></dt>
      <dd>For Node.js tests.</dd>
      <dt><code>jest-allure2-reporter/environment-jsdom</code></dt>
      <dd>For browser tests.</dd>
      <dt><code>jest-allure2-reporter/environment-extend</code></dt>
      <dd>For advanced use cases where you need to extend your already customized test environment.</dd>
    </dl>
  </dd>
</dl>

The produced reports look like directories with multiple JSON files.
They can be viewed using the [`allure` command-line tool][allure-cli], a flexible, feature-rich reporting tool that provides clear and concise test result representation.

## Why one more Allure reporter for Jest?

With Jest's evolution from Jasmine to its own [Circus test runner](https://github.com/jestjs/jest/pull/3668) in [version 27.0.0](https://jestjs.io/blog/2021/05/25/jest-27#flipping-defaults), the testing landscape shifted dramatically. While this change brought new opportunities for enhanced testing, it also created a void: existing Allure reporters[^1], designed for Jasmine, fell short of leveraging Jest's new capabilities.

While community-made reporters sought to bridge this gap[^2][^3][^4], they were not without limitations. Issues with irregular maintenance, limited reach, and significant feature gaps were prevalent. Most critically, they took a non-idiomatic approach by acting as extensions to Jest's `testEnvironment`, which led to a critical shortcomings: e.g., inability to report early test issues like `SyntaxError` or test environment setup failures.

## Conclusion

Jest Allure 2 Reporter is not just another Allure reporter; it's a powerful tool tailor-made for the modern Jest ecosystem. By effectively capturing data from Jest's test environment, it provides comprehensive insights into your tests.
