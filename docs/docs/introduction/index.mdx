## What is `jest-allure2-reporter`?

[`jest-allure2-reporter`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest-allure2-reporter) is a reporting toolkit for [Jest](https://jestjs.io/), a widely popular testing framework in the JavaScript ecosystem.

The produced reports look like directories with multiple JSON files.
They can be viewed using the [`allure` command-line tool][allure-cli], a flexible, feature-rich reporting tool that provides clear and concise test result representation.

It provides several **entry points**:

<dl>
  <dt><code>jest-allure2-reporter</code></dt>
  <dd>The reporter itself, which is responsible for collecting test results and generating a report.</dd>
  <dt><code>jest-allure2-reporter/api</code></dt>
  <dd>DSL to add additional metadata to your test definitions: <code>$Link</code>, <code>$Owner</code>.</dd>
  <dd>`allure` runtime API to use inside your tests: <code>allure.step</code>, <code>allure.attachment</code>.</dd>
  <dt>
    <b>Environment packages</b>, to enable the annotations, media attachments and provide additional test data:
  </dt>
  <dd>
    <dl>
      <dt><code>jest-allure2-reporter/environment-node</code></dt>
      <dd>For Node.js tests.</dd>
      <dt><code>jest-allure2-reporter/environment-jsdom</code></dt>
      <dd>For browser tests.</dd>
      <dt><code>jest-allure2-reporter/environment-decorator</code></dt>
      <dd>For advanced use cases where you need to extend an already customized test environment.</dd>
    </dl>
  </dd>
</dl>

## Why one more Allure reporter for Jest?

Let's start from the fact that **none** of the existing Allure reporters[^1][^2][^3][^4] for Jest is a **reporter** in the Jest sense. Both official and unofficial implementations are built as custom test environment implementations in Jest, whereas _test environments were never meant to be used as reporters_.

You may ask, _"So what? As long as that approach works, why should I care?"_. Valid thinking, but... try running a test file with a syntax error and see how the existing reporters handle it. You'll be surprised.

That was just one example of issues that arise when you don't implement a reporter as a _reporter_. Let's move the next point of failure happening early â€“ test environment setup.

At Wix, we've been maintaining CI pipelines for hundreds of Detox E2E projects, and one of the reasons why a test environment would fail to initialize could be an Android emulator being unresponsive or disconnected before the test file even started. So, when a test environment itself can break, is that the best place to put your core reporting logic?

A few more important questions we've been struggling to answer were:

* You may have executed dozens of test files, but where do you put attachments related to the whole test run?
* How do you attach links to the test file's source code on GitHub which failed due to a syntax error and even didn't start?

This is the reason why `jest-allure2-reporter` was born, and this is why it's the _idiomatic_ Allure reporter for Jest.

To sum it up, here's a comparison of the existing Allure reporters for Jest:

| Feature | jest-allure2-reporter | allure-jest | jest-allure | jest-circus-allure-environment | jest-allure-circus |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Attachments API | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: | :heavy_check_mark: |
| Early test issues reporting | :heavy_check_mark: | :x: | :x: | :x: | :x: |
| TODO                        | | | | | |
