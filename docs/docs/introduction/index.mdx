## What is `jest-allure2-reporter`?

[`jest-allure2-reporter`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/jest-allure2-reporter) is a highly configurable reporter for [Jest](https://jestjs.io/), a widely popular testing framework in the JavaScript ecosystem.

The produced reports look like directories with multiple JSON files, `${uuid}-container.json` and `${uuid}-result.json`, with optional media attachments and a few other files.
They can be viewed or transformed to HTML using the [`allure` command-line tool][allure-cli], a flexible, feature-rich reporting tool that provides clear and concise test result representation.

## Why one more Allure reporter for Jest?

Other reporters are either outdated, have limited features, or are not idiomatic to Jest's new test lifecycle – they are often implemented as a custom test environment, whereas the Jest expects reporters to be _reporters_, pluggable classes that can be swapped in and out.

The common syndrome of existing Allure reporters is that they fall short in reporting early setup failures, tackling duplicate test names and many other edge cases, which hinders the use in large-scale projects, where it is impossible to manually fix all the issues, and it is simpler just to have a tool that works out of the box.

Advanced users also would be pleased to know that `jest-allure2-reporter` can be configured at any level: configuration, DSL, decorators, docblocks and runtime API level.
It can work even without any special test environment, albeit with some limitations, because it was built originally as a _Jest reporter_.

## Takeaways

* This reporter is a powerful tool tailor-made for the **modern** Jest ecosystem, not "yet another Allure reporter".
* Easy to understand, straightforward to adopt, and flexible to work with – it's the Jest Allure reporter you've been waiting for.
* It is progressive by design &mdash; you can start using it like a [standard reporter][jest-reporters], but the more you invest in it, the more you get out of it.
