# By Story

:::caution

This website version refers to the unreleased version of `jest-allure2-reporter` and is not yet available
anywhere. Please use GitHub docs for the latest stable version.

![Grouping by story](../../../img/screenshots/config-01-grouping-05.jpg)

This grouping option stems from the [Behavior-Driven Development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development) (BDD) methodology and
allows users to group test results based on the **epic**, **feature** and **story** to which each test case belongs, where:

* **epic** is a high-level business goal.
* **feature** is a functionality that delivers business value.
* **story** is a user story that describes a feature from the end-user perspective.

This grouping is not enabled by default. Moreover, you need to decide how exactly you want to enable it: via [configuration](#configuration-api) or [annotations](#annotations-api).

## Annotations API

The [annotation-based approach](../../api/08-labels.mdx) gives you a fine-grained control over the names of your Epic, Feature and Story labels, but it requires you to add annotations to your test cases.

In the previous example, it would make sense to group both client and server tests under the same features like **Login screen** and **Forgot password screen**, whereas the epic would be **Authentication**.

$Epic('Authentication');
$Feature('Login screen');
describe('Login controller', () => {
  $Story('should validate e-mail on server');
  it('should validate e-mail', () => {
    // ...
  });

  $Story('should return 401 if user is not found');
  it('should return 401 if user is not found', () => {
    // ...
  });
});
```

## Configuration API

The **configuration-based approach** allows you to group test cases based on the available attributes like file path, ancestor describe blocks, test name and so on.

It's a good option if you don't want to add annotations to your test cases by hand, but it's less flexible than the annotation-based approach. Still, it might be useful if your grouping by suite focuses mostly [on the file structure](#file-oriented-example), and you want to add "a fresh perspective" by grouping tests by describe blocks and test names, for example.

Here's a simple example where we map:

* **epic** to the top-level describe block
* **feature** to the second-level describe block
* **story** to the remaining describe blocks and test name itself
