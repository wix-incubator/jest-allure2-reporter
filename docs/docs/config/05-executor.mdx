# Executor

:::caution

This website version refers to the unreleased version of `jest-allure2-reporter` and is not yet available
anywhere. Please use GitHub docs for the latest stable version.

:::

**Executor** information is crucial as it allows you to identify the entity or system that executed the tests.
Typically, this would be a build agent on your CI/CD server, but, in a way, a developer's host machine is also an executor.

While this feature might not be significant for a single test run on your local machine, it becomes invaluable:

* **When you want to navigate the history of your test runs.**
  Executor info provides the necessary URLs and identifiers to form a comprehensive record of your test runs. When viewed over time, this history can reveal trends and patterns that may not be evident from a single test run. Are your tests taking longer to execute? Are they failing more frequently? When did they last pass successfully? These are all questions that the executor info can help answer.
* **When you want to analyze the test results based on the executor.**
  This is a great idea when your tests are flaky, but you suspect that the flakiness is caused by a specific build agent on your CI/CD server.
  Such errors can crop up when the agents are manually provisioned, or when they lack uniformity: variations in network configurations, different software versions, or a shift in the alignment of stars in the night sky above the data center[^1]!

## Configuration

By default, the executor information is included in the report if a CI/CD environment is detected.
However, if you want to report local test runs as well, you'll need to tweak the configuration at your taste, e.g.:

<Tabs groupId="configTab">
  <TabItem value="demo" label="Report">
    <img src={require('../../img/screenshots/config-executor-01.jpg').default} width={398} alt="Executor" />
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="config" label="Config">

```js title="jest.config.js"
const os = require('os');

/** @type {import('@jest/types').Config.InitialOptions} */
module.exports = {
  // ...
  reporters: [
    // ...
    ['jest-allure2-reporter', {
      executor: ({ defaultValue }) => ({
        name: os.hostname(),
        type: os.platform(),

        ...defaultValue,
      }),
    }]
  ],
};
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

The `defaultValue` is based on [`ci-info`] npm package, but it can be overriden just like
shown above in the example.

## Overrides

In the table below you can see the exhaustive list of executor info properties:

| Property       | Description                                                            |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `name`         | A human-readable name of the executor, e.g. Jenkins, Teamcity, etc.    |
| `type`         | The type of the executor: `jenkins`, `teamcity`, `bamboo`, etc.        |
| `url`          | The URL of the executor. TODO                                          |
| `buildOrder`   | The order of the build, used for building trend charts over [History]. |
| `buildName`    | The name of the build.  TODO                                           |
| `buildUrl`     | The URL of the build on the CI/CD server.                              |
| `reportUrl`    | The URL of the Allure report itself, to be used when linking to it.    |
| `reportName`   | The name of the report. TODO                                           |

[^1]: On a more serious note, it is not entirely unheard of for a build agent to have a faulty hardware component, such as a faulty RAM module. Such issues can be hard to detect, as they may only manifest themselves under heavy load, or when the agent is running a specific type of tests.
