There are a few things to know about Jest failures and how they are reported to Allure.

One of the most important things when your builds start failing is to understand what exactly is broken.

By default, the reporter can distinguish only between **Product defects** and **Test defects**. In the context of this reporter:

* A **product defect** is a failed Jest assertion, e.g. `expect(countOfPosts).toBe(1)`.
* A **test defect** is a failed test, e.g. `throw new Error('Something went wrong')`.

It is advisable to invest some time into configuring the reporter to distinguish between different types of product defects, especially if you have end-to-end tests that are prone to flakiness, e.g.:

```js title="jest.config.js"
/**
 * @type {import('@jest/types').Config.InitialOptions}
 */
module.exports = {
  // ... your jest config
  reporters: [
    'default',
    ['jest-allure2-reporter',
      /** @type {import('jest-allure2-reporter').JestAllure2ReporterOptions} */
      {
        categories: [
          {
            name: "Visual Regression",
            matchedStatuses: ["failed"],
            messageRegex: "Expected .*to match a screenshot.*"
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
  ],
};
```

## `beforeAll` and `afterAll` hooks

Jest's test runner lifecycle is not similar to Java testing frameworks, therefore some concepts do not translate well. Here are some things to keep in mind:

* a failure in a `beforeAll` hook will be reported as a test failure for all tests in the suite. (TODO: check if this is true for `afterAll` as well)
  ```
  TODO: add a screenshot
  ```
* a `beforeAll` hook is not considered a test, so it will not be reported as a test in Allure. The only sane place to report it is as the first step of the first test in the suite.
  ```

  ```
* even this approach is not perfect, especially when you use `jest.retryTimes()` â€“ if the first test is retried, the `beforeAll` step will be reported only once, whereas the test will be reported multiple times in "Retries" section.
  ```

## `--bail` option

If you use the `--bail` option, Jest will stop running tests after the first failure. This is useful for debugging, but it also means that you will not see all the failures in the report, and the report itself might be incomplete.

## Early failures

If your test environment setup fails, Jest will not run any tests. If your test file has syntax errors, Jest even won't be able to understand which tests are defined in the file. Therefore, the only way to report these failures is to report them as a test case failure.
