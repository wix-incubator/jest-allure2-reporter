# Statuses

:::caution

This website version refers to the unreleased version of `jest-allure2-reporter` and is not yet available
anywhere. Please use GitHub docs for the latest stable version.

:::

Jest Allure 2 Reporter provides a clear indication of your test cases' statuses, allowing you to immediately see if they have _passed_, _failed_, _broken_, been _skipped_, or are of _unknown_ status.

## Examples

Below you can find examples of code that produces each of the statuses.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="ðŸŸ¢ Passed" default>

Status `passed` is reported when the test case has passed successfully:

```js
test('passed test', () => {
  expect(2 + 2).toBe(4);
});
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="ðŸ”´ Failed">

Status `failed` is reported when the test case has revealed a product defect, or it has invalid assertions:

```js
test('failed test', () => {
  expect(2 + 2).not.toBe(4);
});
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="ðŸŸ¡ Broken">

Status `broken` is reported when the test case has failed due to an error in the test code:

```js
test('broken test', () => {
  const user = null;
  // TypeError: Cannot read property 'name' of null
  expect(user.name).toBe('John');
});
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="âšª Skipped">

Status `skipped` is reported when the test case has been skipped due to a `test.skip` or `test.todo` call:

```js
test.skip('skipped test', () => {
  expect(2 + 2).toBe(4);
});

test.todo('todo test');
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="ðŸŸ£ Unknown">

Status `unknown` is reported when information about the test case result has been lost or not created:

```js
test('unknown test', () => {
  process.exit(0); // the test information will be unrecoverable
});
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Handling broken tests

If your test assertions _throw errors directly_ instead of using or extending
Jest's [`expect` API][expect], they will be reported as &#8288;ðŸŸ¡&nbsp;Broken tests by default.

To report them as ðŸ”´&nbsp;Failed tests, you should enable `errorsAsFailedAssertions`:

```js title="jest.config.js"
module.exports = {
  // ...
  reporters: [
    // ...
    ['jest-allure2-reporter', {
// highlight-next-line
      errorsAsFailedAssertions: true,
    }],
  ],
};
```
