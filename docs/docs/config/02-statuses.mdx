# Statuses

Jest Allure 2 Reporter supports all the standard statuses defined by the Allure Framework.

It provides a clear indication whether your test cases have [`passed`], [`failed`], were [`broken`],
[`skipped`], or whether their status is [`unknown`].

## ðŸŸ¢ Passed {#passed}

Status `passed` is reported when the test case has passed successfully:

```js
test('passed test', () => {
  expect(2 + 2).toBe(4);
});
```

## ðŸ”´ Failed {#failed}

Status `failed` is reported when the test case has revealed a product defect, or it has invalid assertions:

```js
test('failed test', () => {
  expect(2 + 2).not.toBe(4);
});
```

:::tip

You can build a [custom defects classification][defects] system based on
test status, error messages, and stack traces.

:::

## ðŸŸ¡ Broken {#broken}

Status `broken` is reported when the test case has failed due to an error in the test code:

```js
test('broken test', () => {
  const user = null;
  // TypeError: Cannot read property 'name' of null
  expect(user.name).toBe('John');
});
```

:::tip

If your test assertions _throw errors directly_ instead of using or extending
Jest's [`expect` API][expect], they will be reported as &#8288;ðŸŸ¡&nbsp;Broken tests by default.

To report them as ðŸ”´&nbsp;Failed tests, you can use a `status` customizer function:

```js title="jest.config.js"
module.exports = {
  // ...
  reporters: [
    // ...
    ['jest-allure2-reporter', {
      testCase: {
        // highlight-next-line
        status: ({ value }) => value === 'broken' ? 'failed' : value,
      },
    }],
  ],
};
```

:::

## âšª Skipped {#skipped}

Status `skipped` is reported when the test case has been skipped due to a `test.skip` or `test.todo` call:

```js
test.skip('skipped test', () => {
  expect(2 + 2).toBe(4);
});

test.todo('todo test');
```

:::note

There's no way to distinguish between `test.skip` and `test.todo` calls, so both will be reported as skipped.

:::

## ðŸŸ£ Unknown {#unknown}

Status `unknown` is reported when information about the test case result has been lost or not created:

```js
test('unknown test', () => {
  process.exit(0); // the test information will be unrecoverable
});
```

:::info

In the real world scenarios, this might happen if you use `--bail` in Jest with
multiple test suites running in parallel, and one of them fails. In this case,
Jest will exit immediately, and the reporter will not be able to wait for the
test results from the other workers.
