# Environment

:::caution

This website version refers to the unreleased version of `jest-allure2-reporter` and is not yet available
anywhere. Please use GitHub docs for the latest stable version.

**Environment**: Jest Allure 2 Reporter can capture a complete or a filtered view of your test environment (`process.env`). The filtered view can be adjusted based on `include`, `exclude` lists or callback functions.

**Executor (Build Agent)**: The tool captures and displays what build agent executed the test run, providing additional context for the report.
