# Grouping

:::caution

This website version refers to the unreleased version of `jest-allure2-reporter` and is not yet available
anywhere. Please use GitHub docs for the latest stable version.

:::

**Grouping by Suite**: Group your test results according to Package, Parent suite, Suite, Subsuite, and Test case. This feature makes it easier to navigate through your test results and gain insights quickly.

**Grouping by Story**: Group your test results based on the narrative structure of Epic, Feature, and Story tags. This makes your test results more readable and easier to understand.

**Grouping by Package**: Jest Allure 2 Reporter allows you to group test results by "packages - test classes - test methods" offering a tree-like structure of test results for better visibility.

**Grouping by Defect Category**: Group your test results by defect category. This feature allows you to classify your test failures into different categories such as Product defects, Test defects and any custom categories fit for your project.

## Defect Category ðŸš§

Classify your test failures into different categories such as Product defects, Test defects and any custom categories fit for your project, e.g.:

```js title="jest.config.js"
/**
 * @type {import('@jest/types').Config.InitialOptions}
 */
module.exports = {
  // ... your jest config
  reporters: [
    'default',
    ['jest-allure2-reporter',
      /** @type {import('jest-allure2-reporter').JestAllure2ReporterOptions} */
      {
        categories: [
          {
            name: "Visual Regression",
            matchedStatuses: ["failed"],
            messageRegex: "Expected .*to match a screenshot.*"
          }
        ]
      }
    ],
  ],
};
```

This feature gives you the flexibility to organize the discovered defects in a way that makes the most sense for your project.
