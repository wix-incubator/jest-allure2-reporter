# Test Status

Jest Allure 2 Reporter provides a clear indication of your test cases' statuses, allowing you to immediately see if they have _passed_, _failed_, _broken_, been _skipped_, or are of _unknown_ status.

## Examples

Below you can find examples of code that produces each of the statuses.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="Passed" default>

Status `passed` is reported when the test case has passed successfully:

```js
test('passed test', () => {
  expect(2 + 2).toBe(4);
});
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Failed">

Status `failed` is reported when the test case has revealed a product defect, or it has invalid assertions:

```js
test('failed test', () => {
  expect(2 + 2).not.toBe(4);
});
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Broken">

Status `broken` is reported when the test case has failed due to an error in the test code:

```js
test('broken test', () => {
  const user = null;
  // TypeError: Cannot read property 'name' of null
  expect(user.name).toBe('John');
});
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Skipped">

Status `skipped` is reported when the test case has been skipped due to a `test.skip` or `test.todo` call:

```js
test.skip('skipped test', () => {
  expect(2 + 2).toBe(4);
});

test.todo('todo test');
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="Unknown">

Status `unknown` is reported when information about the test case result has been lost or not created:

```js
test('unknown test', () => {
  process.exit(0); // the test information will be unrecoverable
});
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Handling broken tests

If you are using assertions (matchers, expectations) that throw errors directly
instead of using Jest's `expect` API, and you want to treat these errors as broken tests,
there is a way to do it.

In your Jest config file, add an options object to the `jest-allure` reporter config with
`errorsAsFailedAssertions` set to `true`:

```diff
module.exports = {
  // ...
  reporters: [
    // ...
-   'jest-allure',
+   ['jest-allure', {
+     errorsAsFailedAssertions: true,
+   }],
  ],
};
```

## Categorizing errors

Allure 2 Framework provides a way to categorize errors by defining category names and regular expressions to match against error messages.
Read more about it on the [Defect Categories](categories.mdx) feature page.
