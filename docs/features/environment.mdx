# Environment

**Environment**: Jest Allure 2 Reporter can capture a complete or a filtered view of your test environment (`process.env`). The filtered view can be adjusted based on `include`, `exclude` lists or callback functions.

**Executor (Build Agent)**: The tool captures and displays what build agent executed the test run, providing additional context for the report.
