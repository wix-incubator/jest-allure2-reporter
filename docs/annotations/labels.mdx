# Labels

Any, or most of the labels can be attached both to test suites and test cases. Practically, this means a cascade-like inheritance of labels from the test suite to the test case level.

Attach various labels to your tests such as 'flaky', custom tags (value), custom labels (key=value), JIRA, TMS, or any other custom labels to provide additional context and detail.
