# Description

Any test benefits from a good description.
It helps to understand the purpose of the test and the expected outcome.
It also helps to understand the test when it fails.

Allure Framework allows rich text descriptions in Markdown format.
However, if you don't have any description, the reporter will still
make it look good by pasting the source code of the test.

`TODO: add screenshot`

## Configuration

There are two options regarding including the source code of the test: `includeSourceCode`,
`omitJSDoc`.

Both are `true` by default, so, for example, this test will be reported without the source code:

```js
it('should add two numbers', () => {
  /**
    * This test adds two numbers.
    */
  const a = 1;
  const b = 2;
  const sum = a + b;
  expect(sum).toBe(3);
});
```

TODO: See the configuration section for more details.
