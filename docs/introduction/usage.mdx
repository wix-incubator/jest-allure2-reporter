# Usage

:::caution

This website version refers to the unreleased version of `jest-allure2-reporter` and is not yet available
anywhere. Please use GitHub docs for the latest stable version.

:::

Run your tests with `jest` as usual, e.g.:

```bash
npm test
# jest ...
# PASS  ./my.test.js
```

and then browse the results stored in the `allure-results` directory via:

```bash
allure serve
```

If you want to generate a static report, e.g., for CI, run:

```bash
allure generate
```

For more information on `allure` CLI itself, see the documentation on its [official website](https://docs.qameta.io/allure/#_get_started).

:::danger Caution

**Qameta Software** also provides a commercial [Allure TestOps](https://qameta.io/) solution, which is a cloud-based test management platform that allows you to store, manage, and analyze your test results. Since Qameta is a company partially[^1] based in **Russian Federation**, we strongly advise **to refrain from using their commercial solutions** due to the [Russian invasion of Ukraine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine_(2022)).

:::tip Tip

For simpler use cases, you can use [Allure Docker Service](https://github.com/fescobar/allure-docker-service) to set up a centralized Allure server
in your internal network and configure your CI to send test results to it. This way, you can leverage such advanced features as
Test History, Trends, etc.

If you are looking for a commercial test management solution (self-hosted or cloud-based), we recommend using the open-source [Report Portal](https://reportportal.io/). They provide their own Jest integration, which you can find [here](https://github.com/reportportal/agent-js-jest#readme).
