# Descriptions

:::caution

This website version refers to the unreleased version of `jest-allure2-reporter` and is not yet available
anywhere. Please use GitHub docs for the latest stable version.

:::

A well-written description can enhance the usefulness of a test by providing clear context and expected outcomes. It can also assist in deciphering test failures.

There are two ways to define a description for an executable block:

* declaratively, via `@desc`, `@description`, `@descriptionHtml` JSDoc annotations (or even without them);
* programmatically, via `$Description('')` or `$DescriptionHtml('')` annotation functions.

The **description** can be defined for the built-in `it`, `test`, `beforeAll`, `beforeEach`, `afterAll`, `afterEach` blocks and [custom steps](steps.mdx).

This article will focus on the built-in blocks.

## Test cases

Allure Framework supports rich text descriptions for tests. But don't worry if you don't provide a description. The reporter will still present the test neatly by displaying the source code of the test.

<Tabs groupId="approach">
  <TabItem value="jsdoc" label="JSDoc">

```js
it('should add two numbers', () => {
  /**
    * _Implicit_ annotation without `@desc` or `@description`.
    */
  const a = 1;
  const b = 2;
  const sum = a + b;
  expect(sum).toBe(3);
});

it('should subtract two numbers', () => {
  /**
    * @descriptionHtml
    * <i>Explicit</i> annotation with <code>@descriptionHtml</code>.
    */
  const a = 1;
  const b = 2;
  const diff = b - a;
  expect(diff).toBe(1);
});
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="dsl" label="Function">

```js
$Description('_Implicit_ annotation without `@desc` or `@description`.')
it('should add two numbers', () => {
  /**
    *
    */
  const a = 1;
  const b = 2;
  const sum = a + b;
  expect(sum).toBe(3);
});

$DescriptionHtml('<i>Explicit</i> annotation with <code>@descriptionHtml</code>.')
it('should subtract two numbers', () => {
  /**
    * @descriptionHtml
    * <i>Explicit</i> annotation with <code>@descriptionHtml</code>.
    */
  const a = 1;
  const b = 2;
  const diff = b - a;
  expect(diff).toBe(1);
});
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="demo" label="Demo">

    TODO: add screenshot

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Test hooks

Test hooks such as `beforeAll`, `beforeEach`, `afterAll`, `afterEach` can also have descriptions since technically they are considered [steps](steps.mdx) in the Allure report.

However, they are limited to plain text descriptions only due to Allure Framework limitations.

<Tabs groupId="approach">
  <TabItem value="jsdoc" label="JSDoc">

```js
beforeAll(() => {
  /** This hook runs before all tests. */
});

beforeEach(() => {
  /** @desc This hook runs before each test. */
});

afterEach(() => {
  /**
    * @description
    * This hook runs after each test.
    */
});
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="dsl" label="Function">

```js
@Description('This hook runs before all tests.')
beforeAll(() => {
  // ...
});

@Description('This hook runs before each test.')
beforeEach(() => {
  // ...
});

@Description('This hook runs after each test.')
afterEach(() => {
  // ...
});
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="demo" label="Demo">

    TODO: add screenshot

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


## Test suites

Unfortunately, it is not possible to define a description for the entire test suite or an individual test suite (`describe` block) due to Allure Framework limitations.

However, if you add a description on top of the test suite, it will be prepended to every test description within the suite, e.g.:

<Tabs groupId="approach">
  <TabItem value="jsdoc" label="JSDoc">

```js
describe('Sanity: Login flow', () => {
  /** This description will be prepended to every test description. */

  it('should login with valid credentials', () => {
    /** This test logs in with valid credentials. */
  });

  it('should login with invalid credentials', () => {
    /** This test logs in with invalid credentials. */
  });
});
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="dsl" label="Function">

```js
$Description('This description will be prepended to every test description.')
describe('Sanity: Login flow', () => {
  $Description('This test logs in with valid credentials.')
  it('should login with valid credentials', () => {
  });

  $Description('This test logs in with invalid credentials.')
  it('should login with invalid credentials', () => {
  });
});
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="demo" label="Demo">

    TODO: add screenshot

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Configuration

:::caution Work in progress
:::

You can configure whether the source code of the test is included or not, using the `includeSourceCode` and `omitJSDoc` options. By default, both are set to `true`.

As a result, the following test will be reported without JSDoc annotations:

```js
it('should add two numbers', () => {
  /**
    * This test adds two numbers.
    */
  const a = 1;
  const b = 2;
  const sum = a + b;
  expect(sum).toBe(3);
});
```

TODO: See the configuration section for more details.
